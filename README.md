# Basic MASM Text Editor
The aim is to create a text editor based on IcZelion's MASM tutorials, building on the Rich Text incrementally adding functionality to the package.

## Assembling the package
Simply click on [makeit.bat](makeit.bat), to assemble the package automatically.

## Features
The current iteration includes a basic text editor, with the following functionality implemented:
* Open/Save
* Select all
* Undo/Redo
* Copy/Paste

### Future features
We intend to take advantage of the multiple document interface (MDI) to create multiple editors in one parent window. This is already in progress.
